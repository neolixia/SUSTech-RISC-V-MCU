 Finished: This week, I have read the paper PULP-NN: Accelerating Quantized Neural Networks on Parallel Ultra-Low-Power RISC-V Processors.
 I have got some kownledge about Pulp-NN:
 1. The Pulp-NN accelaration effect is really prominant, and it is faster than the CMSIS-NN library which is run on the arm.
 2. The Pulp-NN accelaration can accelarate just on the pulp without any other co-processor that is based on the arm.
 3. The paper introduce that because large network layers may not fit the MCU on-board memory, buy a set of QNN kernel helps solved this problem. 
 
 Unfinished: Because too many class work to do, so I have not read the paper carefully and sumarized the content.

 To do next week: Summarize the paper.
